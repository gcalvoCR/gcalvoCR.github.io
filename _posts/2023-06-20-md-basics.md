# Markdown Syntax

Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text. It is widely used for creating documents, README files, and web content. Markdown uses simple syntax to indicate formatting elements. Here are some commonly used Markdown syntax elements

## Headings

Headings are created by adding one to six hash (#) symbols at the beginning of a line, with one hash indicating the highest level of heading and six hashes indicating the lowest level of heading
```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

```

## Emphasis
To emphasize text, you can use asterisks (*) or underscores (_).

```md
*Italic text*
_Italic text_

**Bold text**
__Bold text__
```

## Lists
You can create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists.
```md
Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```
## Links
You can create clickable links using square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL.

```md
[Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```
## Images
To include images, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses for the image URL.

```md
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Code
To include inline code or code blocks, surround the code with backticks (`) for inline code or three backticks for code blocks. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting in code blocks

```md
`inline code`

    ```python
        def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
    ```    

```
